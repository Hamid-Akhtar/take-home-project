# Take Home Project

# Configuration 
There should be a `config.ts` file inside [https://github.com/Hamid-Akhtar/take-home-project/src](https://github.com/Hamid-Akhtar/take-home-project/tree/master/src) that exports a variable by default having keys of `username` and `token`. 
`username` should have the value of the github username and `token` is the <b>Personal Access Token</b> required to authenticate Github API. 
<br/>For example, 
`
export default {
    username: <USERNAME>,
    token: <PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
}
`

# Start the project
Run `npm install` and then `npm start` to execute the project on local server. The project runs at http://localhost:4200 by default.
